                    <p2>The Scaffold Service is a consultation and therapy service for looked after and adopted children. The client asked for a logo that represents their brand, based on a quickly drawn mockup of what he wanted. His idea included a background of “adult” silhouettes in the placement as though it looks like they are holding arms which in turn created a ladder effect as each arm sits on top of the each other representing the idea of a scaffold. The main focus being a figure in the middle in much smaller proportions to represent a child hence surrounded by the support of adults.</p2>

                    <p2>Last Summer, I felt it was important to keep up and improve my illustrative skills. Inspired by my friend that had started tonal drawing for family and friends, I thought I could do the same with colourful, realistic digital illustrations. I created a series of nine illustrations using images of my own, starting with using close-up photos as this was easier to illustrate detail but as well as challenging myself to using photos of multiple people and animals. I gifted my prints to friends and famiy which recieved such a great response, as well as posting them on my instagram page recieving future requests from other people who also loved my illustrations.</p2>

                    <p2>Lead the Way is an annual student conference held by students of Ulster University. I was asked to design a logo that would be printed on t-shirts for the year group to wear on the day of the conference. The client suggested the idea of using arrows so I began sketching out different layouts which lead me to the favourite design shown below. The focus of this project was more so on typography which I believe is successfully incorporated into the design.</p2>

The theme of the event was Saint Patrick's Day and therefore I had to design accordingly. Using my Special Occasicon for Saint Patrick's Day, I altered it slightly and incorporated it in the design.

                    <p2>SBD Events required a few illustrations to visualise their ideas for a marquee design so that they can show their client their vision for a particular event. Based on their description of how they planned the marquee to look, I design a variation of illustrations resulting to the completed two images below - one a view from the outside and another showing the inside view. SBD Events was very impressed with the outcome as believe it visualised exactly what they imagined.

        <div class="scaffold1"><h8>The Scaffold Service</h8><br><Br>
            <p2>The Scaffold Service is a consultation and therapy service for looked after and adopted children. The client asked for a logo that represents their brand, based on a quickly drawn mockup of what he wanted. His idea included a background of “adult” silhouettes in the placement as though it looks like they are holding arms which in turn created a ladder effect as each arm sits on top of the each other representing the idea of a scaffold. The main focus being a figure in the middle in much smaller proportions to represent a child hence surrounded by the support of adults.
                He was unsure of the size/proportions, the number of heads required, use of colour or typography and therefore left it up to me to present different variations.</p2></div>
            <div class="scaffoldimg1"><img class="border3" src="scaffold1.PNG" style="width:80%"></div>
            
            <div class="scaffold2">
            <p2><B>Shape:</B> The client was clear that every figure would just be a simplistic shape, no faces and limited detail and therefore I could begin creating the shape of the background silhouettes. This actually became more complicated than expected to fit their heads in without overlapping too much. I then added a small child like character to the front however this was later stripped back as I felt the clothing and shape of the child was too young and gimmicky - it looked too much like a cartoon figure. Therefore a more straight forward silhouette figure was created, making sure that the child’s proportions were smaller than the adults in the background.</p2>
            </div><div class="scaffold3">
            <p2><b>Colours:</b> In the client’s original sketch they had used several colours in the background of their logo idea however we both agreed that this looked too busy and the colours contrasted. It was left up to me to give other suggestions; I wanted to use colours that would reflect his caring industry of work but found it difficult to select the perfect colours. So I began experimenting with colours I know complimented each other, endless number of colour variations were created and sent to the client. Personally I preferred the use of a single colour but using different shades in almost a gradient like effect as I felt this was less in your face and the small figure in the front to be a white silhouette as when I used colour I felt this figure looked rather alien looking.</p2>
            <br><Br>
            <p2><b>Typography:</b> This was another factor he was unsure about whether the title should be included, what typeface, it’s placement. I tried a number of different typefaces and layouts but felt a very simple sans serif font fitted with the simple icon image. I ended up choosing the font ‘Halyard Display’ in the extra light font weight; nothing that stands out over the image but it’s placement fills the awkward white space in the top right hand corner.</p2>
            <br><Br>
            <p2>The client was more than happy with the logo produced shown below on the right, and actually preferred my original colour choices using a range of orange to yellow colours.</p2>
