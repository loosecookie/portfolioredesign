    <h2>Travelling Population</h2>
        <p>An illustrative infographic to provide you with all the information and statistics you could possibly want to know about the topic of travel.<br><Br><a class="button1" target="blank" href="https://loosecookie.tumblr.com/tagged/infographic">Research Notes</a></p>

        <p3>Approximately 7,600,000,000 people in the world, many of which find the time and money to travel. But where are they wishing to adventure?</p3><br><br>
        <br>
        <p2>After collecting the data, I visualised each country by a popular landmark or well-known character in the form of an icon. Using a graph I resized each icon according to the total number of visits of that particular country. Hopefully, making it more recognisable that France is the most popular place of travel compared to Thialand which is the 10th most popular area of travel.</p2></div>

            <p3>Millenials are thought to be the generation of travel as 78% choose to splurge on experiences over "things". With the development of social media it entices them to explore the world around us and in turn, take a selfie while you're there!</p3><br><br><br>
            <p2>With this fact, I thought it would be important and fun to include a section that visualises the world's top 10 most instagrammed attractions which is more relatable to the millenial generation. Creating polaroid illustrations to match the idea behind Instagram and photo collections. </p2></div>

            <h8>The Travelling Population Infographic</h8><br><Br>
            <p2>Using data visualisation, my task was to develop an infographic based on a topic of choice however regarding the idea of population, providing information and statistics that I had gathered and researched myself. I have provided all the need to know information about the travelling population. From the more basic line graphs to highly illustrative icons, I've tried to include a range of data visualisation techniques.  </p2><br><br><br>

            <h8>Reflections</h8><br><br>
            <p2>This project showed me the endless possibilities in which data can be presented in a more informative way rather than confusing tables or paragraphs. And in fact I found the most challenging part actually collecting the information I wanted to use, as online provides multiple sources usually showing different statistics which can be unclear, as well as trying to find the most up to date figures. However this was eventually overcome and especially after endlessly researching, I wanted to create a simple and easy to follow infographic. As you can see, my travel infographic is highly illustrative as I find this makes analysing data easier to understand and is obviously more fun to design.</p2>
