        <div class="uxpert1"><h8>The Brief</h8><br><br>
        <p2>We want to improve UX education with the help of an online learning platform, moving away from traditional university teaching and looking into potentially the future of education. This project is really all about gathering extensive research, examining the current educative landscape and visualising how we can improve on what's already existing. In the end, I have produced a prototype of my idealistic e-learning platform.
        </p2></div>

        <div class="uxpert2"><h8>The Monzo of UX education</h8><br><Br>
        <p2>Monzo is a mobile banking app that has changed the way we bank as all their resources are online. There isn't a physical branch you can visit, everything you need to access is within the use of an app on your phone. But what sets Monzo's app aside from existing mobile banking apps? Monzo go above and beyond to offer a number of different services through the use of great UX design that include the likes of; transaction notifications, budegting tools, charts to track your spending, categorising your spending, golden ticket invitations and the availablity to freeze your card if you think you have lost it.
        <br><br>
        Taking into account all the elements that Monzo offer, plus many more, I want to be achieving a similar level of innovation and great UX when it comes to the ideation and design of my UX school. The Big Hairy Audacious Goal is to create the Monzo of UX education, producing an idea that would over shadow all competitive platforms teaching UX so that my idea would be the best in the industry.</p2>

        <div class="uxpert3"><h8>Competitor Benchmarking - Existing Issues?</h8><br><br>
        <p2>Starting of my exploring what is already out there in terms of e-learning platforms. We looked at the likes of Skillshare, Codeacademy, Futurelearn, Udemy, Coursera, Treehouse and many more. Identifying areas that I thought were useful as well as areas that require improvment so that the same mistakes couldn't be made for my platform. Issues include;</p2><br><Br>
            
        <p2>
        <b>Content:</b> Often found there was limited course/module breakdown in terms of what a student would actually be learning. As well as a lack of pathway/structure making it difficult for first time users to understand how they go about learning. Large number of platforms use just video to deliver content, which perhaps doesn’t suit all learning styles.<br>
        <b>Quality Control:</b> Skillshare and Udemy allow a range of different designers to upload content for students, and due to low entry barriers this won’t always ensure that the content provided is of a high standard. For this reason, students could spend a lot of time sieving through content or learning useless information. This can also make it difficult to learn when jumping between different tutors who likely follow different teaching styles, methods and tools.<Br>
        <b>Low Interactivity:</b> Often offering little to no student support from the likes of a tutor, without this interactivity for problem solving or feedback your learning experience is surely limited.<Br>
        <b>Cost:</b> The cost of learning varied anything from offering free services to paying £10,000. The more expensive option would perhaps suggest higher quality content however it’s impossible to identify the quality of the course based on solely it’s price. And do all students have that kind of money spare to invest?<br>
        <b>Certification:</b> Not always was a incentive offered in terms of a qualification or even an achievement scheme. Am I building an alternative to traditional University courses were they would receive a formal degree or am I building an addition to University, a space were students can gain access to further learning.<br>
        <b>Little sense of Community</b>: Learning online is often learning alone, there isn’t a sense of a classroom with fellow learning students. Some platforms such as CodeAcademy offer community forums with the idea that students would talk and ask questions amongst themselves. However this idea often fails when it is a forum of crazy large numbers.
</p2></div>
            
        <div class="uxpert5"><h8>Competitor Benchmarking - Useful Areas?</h8><br><br>
        <p2>As well as the previously mentioned issues, there are a number of good points picked up along the way that I could incorporate into my UX school:<br><Br>

    <b>Strong Branding:</b> FutureLearn and Thinkful focused on brand colour consistency and small iconography, which improves the aesthetics of the overall site - you wouldn’t want to be learning design from a website that follows bad design as this would only suggest what the content provided is like. <br>
    <b>Profile Dashboard:</b> FutureLearn and Code Academy provide a dashboard for each student to keep track of what they are currently learning and have previously learnt. This idea could be further developed so that using data it could measure a student’s engagement with particular courses - the likes of a progression tab would visually keep track of their learning. <br>
    <b>Recommendations:</b> Code Academy provided a questionnaire to students once they sign up so that their recommendations list would be personalised to them.<br>
    <b>Downloadable Options:</b> Udemy offer content in the form of videos which with the click of a button can be downloaded for watching offline or at a different time. <br>
    <b>Add to Wishlist:</b> FutureLearn offer an ‘add to wishlist’ option that bookmarks a course you are interested to save for later.<br>
    <b>Projects:</b> A number of platforms provide projects and exercises for students to carry out if they want after learning the content. I believe that this is a must as learning design is only really taught by doing, you learn with every piece of design you create. Skillshare encourage you to post your projects in a social media like form receiving likes and comments from other students. A good way of receiving feedback from fellow students and a tutor.<br>
    <b>Gamification:</b> Codeacademy provide gamification through achievable badges which is a good idea for keeping students intrigued and using their service.<br>
    <b>Daily Notifications:</b> Duolingo use streaks to encourage students to daily return and learn and therefore achieving goals.</p2></div>

        
        <div class="uxpert4"><h8>How Might We?</h8><br><br>
        <p2>How Might We is an exercise of the ideation phase, explained by IDEO's Design Kit, to identify the kinds of questions and key points of a particular product brief. Our main question is How might we improve UX education? However this can be broken down further into individual points that we must consider as we develop our ideas for our UX school. This points are derived from our findings of competitor benchmarking research. Beside shows me carrying out the how might we exercise in order to start building my ideas.</p2>
        </div>

        <div class="howmightwe"><img class="border3"  src="howmightwe.png" style="width:100%"></div>

        <div class="uxpert6"><h8>Addition or Alternative?</h8><br><br>
        <p2>My reasoning against building an alternative to traditional university learning is mainly because I’m not favourable to putting a price on my platform, where you have to pay a large fee in order to take part in a particular course. I don’t see a large audience signing up and paying huge money for online content especially because they won’t be sure of the quality of content. I know as a student I’d be reluctant to do the same. Even with platforms that offer free content, there is often the option to upgrade to a premium service at a smaller charge. Again I'm not favourable to this idea as I think it shuts out those students who can’t afford to receive the extra learning materials and therefore stops them from growing their career.<br><br>

        However building an addition to traditional university learning.
        I could offer free learning materials, encouraging students to use my service. And although there won’t be the opportunity to receive a recognised qualification, building on my last point I think there should be the opportunity for hard working students to upgrade. Something similar to the likes of reaching certain goals allows you to unlock content or perhaps a more gamification aspect were with every module you complete you receive a number of points which can be traded in to receive extra materials. So that it’s not always the students who can afford to unlock content but the motivated and hard working students that can earn their learning.
            <br></Br>
        I believe building an addition would attract motivated students as they already want to learn more than the baseline they currently are and therefore focusing on developing these eager to learn students. </p2></div>
            
            
        <div class="uxpert7"><h8>Adjecent Possible: Forest</h8><br><br>
        <p2>Forest is an app that helps you to put down your phone and successfully learn, I first heard of Forest from a friend who used the app when she was still in school to help her revise for exams. You must stay on the app on order to successfully grow your tree which ultimately stops you from getting distracted by using your phone. After a set amount of time, you will have grown a tree that is then added to your personal forest. This way you can keep working on building your forest while successfully revising.<br><br>
            
        Online learning can be very distracting when there are so many more interesting things to find on the internet, therefore introducing this concept was very intriguing to me. I came up with a similar idea, using a pattern that can grow as you develop rather than a tree that grows.</p2></div>
            
        <div class="forest"><img src="forest.png" style="width:60%"></div>

        <div class="uxpert8"><h8>My Developed Idea</h8><br><br>
        <p2>Developing on from my points about motivation and keeping students interested in learning, I came up with a pattern concept. Every student will build their own unique pattern that is shown on their profile dashboard. In order to build this pattern they must complete modules, with every module completion a new puzzle piece will be added. Similarly to the app Forest, I believe this idea will encourage students to keep working. I think it could even be developed further so that after recieving a certain number of pattern pieces you can begin to unlock hidden content that will boost your learning, it rewards hard workers rather than paying upgraders. With the inclusion of a leaderboard to track students patterns, this would introduce healthy competition again, similar to what you see in a traditional class room, as students work against each other to reach the top of the leaderboard.</p2><br><br><br></div>
            
         <div class="pattern"><img src="pattern.png" style="width:100%"></div>
            
        <div class="uxpert9"><h8>User flows and Wireframes</h8><br><br>
        <p2>With my research complete and my ideas generated, it was time to develop the structure of my website by building numerous user flows and wireframes of the different required screens. Introducing my built brand for this project also, in terms of logo, colour palette and brand dictionary.</p2></div>
        
        <div class="uxpertflow"><img class="border3" src="uxpertflow.png" style="width:100%"></div>
        <div class="uxpertwireframes"><img class="border3" src="uxpertwireframes.png" style="width:100%"></div>

        <div class="uxpertreflection"><h8>Final Outcome &amp; Reflections</h8><br><br>
        <p2>This project taught me the importance of research, especially when building a product in a highly competitive field. As although we can learn to build aesthetically pleasing functional interfaces, it is more important that the product being provided is of added value in order to fit the gap in the market. I learnt many more important stages to add to my design process, such as card sorting, surveys and how might we exercises, that overall will improve the outcome of my product.<br><br>

            This project also introduced me to prototyping, previously I had used Invision however for my UXpert platform I chose to look at Adobe XD. Exploring their variety of helpful tools, I especially grew to love the ‘auto animate’ feature. I was opened to the importance of prototyping for the purpose of iteration - work can be easily tested and changed along the developing process before you reach your final designs and therefore smoothing out the building process at the end. <Br><br>
            I am pleased with the outcome of UXpert as I believe I have improved on the 3 main problems of online learning platforms - providing better structured content, on-demand student support and especially motivating students when learning online. Along with numerous added value features such as bookmarks, downloaded content, recommendations and so on that would improve a users overall experience.</p2></Br></div>
