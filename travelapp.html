        <p2>Summer's just around the corner, Laura and her friends want to find a cheap and cheerful party holiday but need the help of Disco Destinations. They've decided to have a look at the nightlife in the most popular party island of the world - Magaluf. With our app they can check out the clubs, bar, events and concerts that are on during the summer holiday period. And find out information regarding specific opening times, the cost of entry or whether certain events required them to purchase tickets in advance, they may be interested in the type of music that's played, as well as more importantly having a look at what drink promotions different places have to offer!</p2>

        <h8>Starting with sketches</h8><br><Br>
        <p2>My task was to design an illustrative mobile app regarding the topic of travel - producing at least three digital screens based on inital sketches and wireframes. After mindmapping out potential ideas to do with the topic of travel, I stuck with this idea of a party travel app and therefore began sketching out wireframes and little icons that I knew I'd be including in my app design.</p2></div>

        <h8>Icons and illustrations</h8><br><br>
        <p2>The purpose of this app design is to be illustrative, therefore it was most important to consider the icons and illustrations I needed to include. Two main icon sets I had to create included club/bar/event/concert icons and the cocktail icons which I believe turned out well, both following a flat icon shape and use of bright colours. It was necessary to ensure consistency was shown between the different icon sets which is definitely what I found most difficult. I also recreated a cityscape illustration of a Spanish town because the example I provide is Magaluf, referring to an image of typical traditional Spanish buildings - trying to include certain aspects such as the balcony windows and decorative roofs.</p2></div>

        <h8>Screen development</h8><br><br>
        <p2>I designed 4 screens and a splash screen in order to visualise my idea for the travel app. Starting off with a simple splash screen allowed me to develop Disco Destinations brand in terms of typography, iconography and colour. It was then important to consider app navigation, which screens did I want to develop and how would the user reach that particular screen. From here the main focus was on the iconography and illustrations - considering style, shape and colour. I believe it is more helpful to see my app in action so I created a prototype shown above.</p2>

        <h8>Reflections</h8><br><br>
        <p2>This project helped me gain a better understanding of UX design, outlining that consistency is key when designing every element. For example iconography style, colour and form is important to keep consistent as the user wants to navigate through my app with ease and understanding. Although I was continually developing and changing designs at the time, I still look back now and think there are areas in which consistency could be improved in order to help the user - perhaps less use of colour wouldn't be so distracting and further similarity between each of my icon sets so that they look to be from the same overall set. However at the time of producing this outcome I had previously never explored creating icon sets and so perhaps now this is something I could consider redesigning to make my app even better!</p2>
